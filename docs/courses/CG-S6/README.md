# Complex threefolds from marked torus families

This course develops the complex-geometry S6 construction through its original marked periods, finite fillings, cusp, integral topology, canonical sections and deformation. It preserves the mathematical contributions of the manuscript produced with Claude under Levent Alpöge's direction, Philip Engel's subsequent treatment, and the programme's retained exact calculations.

Start with [lesson 1: Two finite torus quotients and their line bundles](CG-S6-01.html). It proves the explicit product-cover degrees nine and eight, the complete finite group actions, and the smooth trivializations of line bundles of exact holomorphic orders three and four. Its [editable source](src/finite-quotients-and-line-bundles.md) contains every proof and four solved exercises. Continue with [lesson 2: Normal boundaries and their integral maps](CG-S6-02.html), which computes the entire attachment kernel, the explicit group product isomorphism and the integral cohomology covering maps. Its [editable source](src/normal-boundaries-and-integral-maps.md) contains the full proofs and three solved exercises.

Continue with [lesson 3: Varying finite fillings and every base-change branch](CG-S6-03.html). Its [editable source](src/varying-finite-fillings.md) constructs all local period germs with the original transformation laws, proves their exact real-analytic comparison with the normal bundles, computes every normalization branch, and gives the full punctured holomorphic conjugacy. Three further exercises have complete solutions.

Continue with [lesson 4: Global periods and the line-bundle quotient](CG-S6-04.html). Its [editable source](src/global-periods-and-line-bundle-quotients.md) constructs the global periods, proves their exact admissible constant range, identifies the degree-zero line bundle and every quotient map, and calculates the exact contraction factor and cubic scale. Four further exercises have complete solutions. The modular-form prerequisites link to precise, pinned proof providers.

Continue with [lesson 5: The cusp and the compact threefold](CG-S6-05.html). Its [editable source](src/cusp-and-compact-threefold.md) proves the full toric action, properness, non-normal fibre and compact gluing. It also resolves the elliptic fibres explicitly, identifies the period section, computes the section heights and proves the global lift comparison with every scalar factor. Four further exercises have complete solutions; two reproducible figures show the exact fan, gluing units and fibre intersections.

Continue with [lesson 6: Integral monodromy and the fundamental group](CG-S6-06.html). Its [editable source](src/integral-monodromy-and-fundamental-group.md) computes every integral matrix and exterior-power lattice, proves the complete based attachment maps, and derives triviality of the full fundamental group. An explicit integral dictionary compares Engel's marking, with every reversed meridian and circle term. Four solved exercises include actual additional free affine fillings and their cyclic groups.

[Lesson 8](CG-S6-08.html) now proves the complete canonical divisor and graded anticanonical ring, retaining all finite characters, ramification factors and multiple fibres. Its degree-two sections recover the original fibration. Four exercises have complete solutions.

[Lesson 9](CG-S6-09.html) constructs the proper parameter family, calculates its nonzero deformation class and classifies all parameter identifications. The middle family permits every integer shift; the full finite and cusp calculation permits exactly the even shifts. All maps and four solved exercises are included.

[Lesson 11](CG-S6-11.html) proves the exact octonion and Nijenhuis calculations, the smooth integrability theorem, and the almost-complex sphere restriction. Six solved exercises and three complete characteristic-class prerequisite chapters are included.

[Lesson 10](CG-S6-10.html) proves the exact non-normal-fibre correction, proper test family, full-fibre duality and base change, and global nonvanishing for every line-bundle twist. It includes three complete analytical companion chapters and six solved exercises. The [working lesson 7](CG-S6-07.html) makes its integral-topology dependency available; that chapter is explicitly unfinished. Its integral duality, exact affine descent, CW, Hurewicz, path-fibre, cancellation, stable-framing, framed Whitney-disk, supported Whitney-move and original handle-decomposition, index-arrangement, Morse-trajectory, extreme-index removal, cancelling-pair creation and framed index-one removal proofs are included as companions.

The [series map](series.json) retains the full remaining assignment. Lessons 1–6 and 8–11 are available. The analytic lessons 8–9 can be read while the exact topology providers for lesson 7 are completed. The remaining foundational and smooth-recognition proofs remain assigned within lesson 7. Source reading and proof acceptance have separate records.
